=> Initial setup: npx create-next-app appName
=> To run on localhost: npm run dev

=> Next.js is used for server side rendering

=> Next. js is a pre-rendered React app in the client-side that users can view and interact with 
   and can be considered as front-end. At the same time, it also does server-side rendering and 
   API routes which can perform server-side code and access data in the database and can be considered as back-end.

=> pages => index.js will be rendered first

=> Pages and routes:
    - There is prebuilt folder named pages where you can define your pages like about, footer, etc.
    - In pages you can create another folder and can create a component within that folder.
    - When you create a page next will automatically create a route for that page.
    - eg:  - if pagename is home it will automatically create a route called /home
           - if you have a folder inside pages then it will create route according to that.
                1. suppose pages => your_folder_name => index.js then if you visit /your_folder_name then it will display content of index.js
                2. suppose pages => your_folder_name => index.js and test.js then if you visit /your_folder_name then it will display content of index.js
                   and if you visit /your_folder_name/test then it will display content of test.js.

=> If you want to create resuable components like footer or navbar then you can create those by creating a folder called components (or anything you like) 
   under main project folder and then creating components in that folder like Footer.js ot Navbar.js and then import in main index.js file.

=> link component: is used to link elements like in navbar. (replacing anchor tag)
                   In HTML we add href to anchor tag but in next we wraap anchor tab in Link tag and add href to Link.  

=> In next if we navigate to certain page for first time we get served by javascript bundle of that perticular page.
   but if we visit that page again then next will not serve javascript bundle again as we visited the page earlier also.
   And if we visit another page it will serve us with the javascript bundle of that page.
   In short eacg page has its own javascript bundle.
   too check => inspect => networks.

=> Layout component: If we want some component of each and every page like nav ot footer then we can create a layout component
   and wrap content of app.js inside Layout (in App.js file) and will include App.js file's content into footer by accessing a prop
   called children which will render all the content.

=> styles cann be declare by creating folder called styles which will be automatically created by next.js and creating stylesheet inside folder
   globally for all pages for for particular page.
=> global.css is used to style globally. Whatever style you declare here will be set to all pages if that classname or tag present in those pages.
=> filename.module.css is used to style particular page.
=> If you are creating stylesheet for a particular page (particularPage.module.css) then you have to import it in that page as styles
   and you can add styles to tag by using styles.anyName and declaring that anyName in that stylesheet (.anyName{styles here}) .
